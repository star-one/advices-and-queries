'Until we as a Religious Society begin to question our assumptions, until we look at the prejudices, often very deeply hidden, within our own society, how are we going to be able to confront the inequalities within the wider society? (Susan Rooke-Matthews, 1993 in Quaker Faith & Practice of Britain Yearly Meeting, 1993)<br /><em>Intermountain Yearly Meeting, Equality</em>',

'Since the time of George Fox, Friends have believed that all people are spiritually equal before God. Believing that, it is important that Friends everywhere question the prejudices (often deeply hidden) within the Religious Society of Friends and challenge the assumptions we make about others. In the past, Quakers helped foment vast societal changes by challenging the oppression they saw. Today our voices do not ring as loudly nor are they as unified when we confront oppression and inequality. For example, we are deeply divided among ourselves regarding same-gender marriage.<br /><em>Intermountain Yearly Meeting, Equality, Advices, 1</em>',
