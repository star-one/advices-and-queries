'Take care in your relationships with others that you respect and cherish each person, for people of all races and nationalities have that of God within their beings which unites them. Take care also, therefore, to maintain a consistent witness to peace, opposition to war, and to all acts of violence or coercion, that you may remain in accord with the timeless guidance of the Inner Light.<br /><em>North Carolina Yearly Meeting (Conservative), Advices</em>',

'Let early care be taken to advise such as appear inclinable to marry without sufficient reflection; in contemplating the engagement let all look principally to that which will help you on your spiritual journey. Pay filial regard to the judgment of your parents. Bear in mind the vast importance in such a union of an accordance in religious principles and practice. Ask counsel of God, desiring above all temporal considerations that your union may be owned and blessed of Him.<br /><em>North Carolina Yearly Meeting (Conservative), Advices</em>',

'Do you cherish your friendships, so that they grow in depth and understanding and mutual respect? In close relationships we may risk pain as well as finding joy. When experiencing great happiness or great hurt we may be more open to the working of the Spirit.<br /><em>Britain Yearly Meeting, Advices and Queries, number 21</em>',

'Marriage has always been regarded by Friends as a religious commitment rather than a merely civil contract. Both partners should offer with God\'s help an intention to cherish one another for life. Remember that happiness depends on an understanding and steadfast love on both sides. In times of difficulty remind yourself of the value of prayer, of perseverance and of a sense of humour.<br /><em>Britain Yearly Meeting, Advices and Queries, number 23</em>',

'A long-term relationship brings tensions as well as fulfilment. If your relationship with your partner is under strain, seek help in understanding the other\'s point of view and in exploring your own feelings, which may be powerful and destructive. Consider the wishes and feelings of any children involved, and remember their enduring need for love and security. Seek God\'s guidance. If you undergo the distress of separation or divorce, try to maintain some compassionate communication so that arrangements can be made with the minimum of bitterness.<br /><em>Britain Yearly Meeting, Advices and Queries, number 25</em>',
